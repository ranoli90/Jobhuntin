# Deep Audit & Sprint Plan — JobHuntin / Sorce

**Audit Date:** March 2026  
**Scope:** Onboarding, Dashboard, Jobs pipeline, Background services, Profile assembly, API completeness

---

## Sprint 1 Implementation (March 2026)

- **render.yaml**: Added `jobhuntin-job-sync` worker (JobSpy sync every 4h).
- **profile_assembly.py**: New module merging `profile_data`, `user_skills`, `work_style_profiles`, `user_preferences` into `DeepProfile`.
- **job_search.py**: Integrated `profile_assembly` + `score_job_match`; `sort_by` (match_score, salary, date_posted); returns full job dicts with `match_score`.
- **user.py**: `GET /me/jobs` now accepts `sort_by` and passes `user_id` for profile-based scoring.
- **cold_start.py**: Removed `j.status = 'ACTIVE'`; fixed `j.required_skills` → `j.skills`, `j.industry` → `j.company_industry`; simplified similar_users.

## Sprint 2 Implementation (March 2026)

- **ai.py**: `match-job` and `match-jobs-batch` now load profile server-side when client omits it; `profile` is optional.
- **deep_profile.py**: Added `deep_profile_to_llm_dict()` for LLM prompt conversion.
- **job_search.py**, **user.py**, **useJobs.ts**: Added `min_match_score` filter (0-100).

---

## Executive Summary

The product has substantial infrastructure (JobSpy, match scoring, DeepProfile, AI match, auto-apply agent) but **critical connections are missing**. Jobs are not being synced, match scoring is not wired to the feed, profile assembly is fragmented, and several workers/features are stubs or not deployed.

---

## Part 1: Critical Gaps (Must Fix)

### Jobs Pipeline — Broken End-to-End

| # | Gap | Severity | Location |
|---|-----|----------|----------|
| 1 | Jobs table empty in prod — Job sync worker not deployed | **Critical** | `render.yaml`, `apps/worker/job_sync_worker.py` |
| 2 | Match scoring not used in jobs feed — `score_job_match` never called | **Critical** | `job_scoring.py`, `job_search.py`, `user.py` |
| 3 | API does not return `match_score` — jobs feed has no scores | **Critical** | `GET /me/jobs`, `search_and_list_jobs` |
| 4 | `sort_by` (match_score, salary) ignored by API | **High** | `user.py` list_jobs |
| 5 | Profile used only for filters, not for scoring/ranking | **High** | `job_search.py` |
| 6 | Cold start uses non-existent `j.status = 'ACTIVE'` | **High** | `cold_start.py` |

### Profile Assembly — Fragmented

| # | Gap | Severity | Location |
|---|-----|----------|----------|
| 7 | No unified profile assembly — `profile_data` + `user_skills` + `work_style_profiles` never merged | **Critical** | New `profile_assembly.py` needed |
| 8 | `user_skills` and `profile_data.skills` never merged — matching can miss skills | **High** | `ProfileRepo`, `job_scoring` |
| 9 | DeepProfile / `score_job_match` never called — dead code | **High** | `job_scoring.py` |
| 10 | Semantic matching and AI match expect profile from client — API does not load profile | **High** | `ai.py`, `semantic_matching.py` |
| 11 | `deep_profiles` table exists but never populated | **Medium** | `deep_profiles` |

### Onboarding — Data & Validation

| # | Gap | Severity | Location |
|---|-----|----------|----------|
| 12 | DOCX uploads rejected by frontend — `useProfile.uploadResume` only accepts PDF | **High** | `useProfile.ts`, `ResumeStep` |
| 13 | LinkedIn URL from Resume step not persisted until Preferences — lost if user skips | **Medium** | `ResumeStep`, `PreferencesStep` |
| 14 | Career goals: no backend validation for `experience_level`, `urgency` | **Medium** | `user.py` ProfileUpdate |
| 15 | Work style skip: `POST /me/work-style` called with empty answers | **Low** | `WorkStyleStep` |
| 16 | Missing i18n keys: `onboarding.allSet`, `onboarding.almostThere`, etc. | **Low** | `i18n.ts` |

### Dashboard — Missing Features

| # | Gap | Severity | Location |
|---|-----|----------|----------|
| 17 | TeamView is stub — no real team management, only "Upgrade to Team" | **High** | `TeamView.tsx` |
| 18 | Billing page: invoices only — no plan selection or upgrade UI | **High** | `Billing.tsx`, `BillingView.tsx` (unused) |
| 19 | HoldsView snooze: `isSubmitting(\`snooze-${app.id}\`)` never matches | **Medium** | `HoldsView.tsx`, `useApplications` |
| 20 | Phase 12–14 feature pages (pipeline, notifications, etc.) not in nav | **Medium** | `AppLayout.tsx` |
| 21 | BillingView and Dashboard.tsx duplicated — dead code | **Low** | `BillingView.tsx`, `pages/dashboard/Dashboard.tsx` |

### Background Services — Not Deployed

| # | Gap | Severity | Location |
|---|-----|----------|----------|
| 22 | Job sync worker not in Render | **Critical** | `render.yaml` |
| 23 | Job alerts: no cron — `process_alerts` is API-only | **High** | `job_alerts.py` |
| 24 | Email digest: no cron — `run_weekly_digest` is admin-only | **Medium** | `email_digest.py` |
| 25 | Follow-up reminders: not automated — user must trigger | **Medium** | `follow_up_reminders.py` |
| 26 | BackgroundJobQueue: `process_jobs()` never invoked | **Medium** | `job_queue.py` |
| 27 | `NOTIFY job_queue` never sent on application create — agent relies on polling only | **Low** | `user.py` applications |

---

## Part 2: TODO / Stub Implementations

| # | Item | File | Notes |
|---|------|------|-------|
| 28 | applications table lacks tenant_id filter | `main.py:1017` | Add tenant_id when column exists |
| 29 | TTS/STT service integration | `voice_interview_simulator.py` | Placeholder |
| 30 | Resume agent: storage, DB update, analytics, status check | `resume_agent_integration.py` | Multiple TODOs |
| 31 | Follow-up reminders: integrate with EmailCommunicationManager | `follow_up_reminders.py` |
| 32 | Enhanced notifications: support ticket, suspension, dashboard update | `enhanced_notifications.py` |
| 33 | Agent: cover letter generation, portfolio handling, screenshot storage | `agent.py` |
| 34 | Voice interviews: session retrieval from DB | `voice_interviews.py` | Multiple |
| 35 | Billing: concurrent usage tracking | `billing.py` |
| 36 | Resume PDF: cloud storage, statistics | `resume_pdf.py`, `resume_integration.py` |
| 37 | ATS: template retrieval, statistics | `ats_recommendations.py` |
| 38 | DLQ: wire real manager, oldest_item_age | `dlq_endpoints.py` |
| 39 | Communication endpoints: preferences, email sending, analytics, health | `communication_endpoints.py` | Many TODOs |
| 40 | Settings: dark mode | `Settings.tsx` |
| 41 | Mobile: reCAPTCHA, deep link handling | `mobile/src/lib/supabase.ts` |
